## Script Dependencies

Ensure you have the following tools installed:
- **gcloud CLI** - Google Cloud command-line tool
- **terraform** - Infrastructure as Code tool
- **docker** - Container platform
- **go** - Go programming language
- **git** - Version control system

## Configuration Files

Make sure these files are properly configured:
- `terraform.tfvars` - Terraform variables
- `.env` - Environment variables for local development

## Security Notes

- Scripts automatically configure `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive files
- JWT keys and terraform.tfvars are not committed to version control
- Use encrypted PEM files for JWT keys
- All scripts include proper error handling and validation

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
```bash
gcloud auth login
gcloud auth application-default login
gcloud auth configure-docker us-central1-docker.pkg.dev
```

### Permission Issues
```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
```

### Build Issues
```bash
go mod tidy
go mod verify
```
